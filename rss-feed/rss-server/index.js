{/*NOTES:
ðŸŸ¦ Express
Express is a popular web framework for Node.js. It helps you:

Create servers and APIs easily

Handle routes (like /home, /about)

Manage requests and responses (GET, POST, etc.)

Think of it as a lightweight tool that lets you build web apps and REST APIs quickly without needing to write everything from scratch.

ðŸŸ¨ CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
CORS is a browser security feature that controls which domains are allowed to access your server.

By default, browsers block frontend code (like React apps) from making requests to a server on a different domain or port.

The cors package in Node/Express helps you:

Enable or configure CORS rules

Allow certain frontend apps to talk to your server */}
